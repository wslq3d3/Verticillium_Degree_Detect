Verticillium_Degree_Detect
it is system of verticilum_degree_detect in order to fished my master degree paper
step one:donwload python and node.js 
step two:to enter detection-fontend and put "npm install" which will automatically download and install all of relevent dependencies for fontend
step three:enter detection-backend and install relative package manually because I did't prepared requirements.txt
step five:to input "npm run dev" in fontend file start webpack-dev-server and to input "python app.py" in backend file run flask server
it is all of step above things,then open your browser(I recommend Chrome),and input website e.g:http://localhost:8080
